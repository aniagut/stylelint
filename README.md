ec0lint is a static code analysis tool that provides the users with useful hints on how to reduce the digital footprint of their webpages during the development process. Applying code changes suggested by ec0lint will make result with webpages that emit less carbon per visit, load quicker and are more space- efficient. The tool is open-source and community-driven.

## Our goal

An average webpage with 10 000 views monthly emits 4.6 g CO2 with every view. It sums up to 553 kg annually. Thanks to following good practices such as [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/) and code optimization the emissions may be reduced from 4.6 g to 0.2 g emitting only 24 kg CO2 annually. It means that 529 kg (96%!) CO2 could be saved, which is as much as charging 65 000 smartphones.

ec0lint is a tool that can help with that. By static code analysis, it provides improvements to the code and highlights the impact it will have on carbon emissions, loading speed and size. Those improvements can range from decreasing the size and number of images, videos or animations, including a lighter library or an open-source library, changing the font type, font size or background colors.

The tool is customized and each rule applied during the analysis can be adjusted, or treated as hints rather than errors. This flexibility allows the developers to reach their goals without interruptions from ec0lint, at the same time drawing attention to possible improvements.

Thank you!

We are open to collaboration on improving ec0lint, and we are very grateful for all contributions and feedback on the tool. Thank you for helping us make the web greener!
